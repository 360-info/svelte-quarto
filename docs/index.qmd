**Sverto** is an extension for [Quarto](https://quarto.org) that lets you seamlessly write and include [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) components, like charts and other visuals, in your Quarto website.

Your Svelte components can seamlessly react to your ObservableJS code, making it quick and easy to build visuals that animate in response to [user inputs](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/inputs?collection=@observablehq/inputs) or other changing data in your document.

<!-- examples here! -->

## üìã Prerequisites

You'll need to install two things to run Sverto:

- [Quarto](https://quarto.org)
- [Node and the Node Package Manager (npm)](https://nodejs.org)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Install the project extension using:

```
quarto use template 360-info/sverto@firstrelease-docs
```

Then run:

```
npm install
```

This will add the extension itself (which includes some project scripts) to the `_extension` folder, as well as a few other files.

> **Note:** Sverto depends on running [project pre-render scripts](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/scripts.html#pre-and-post-render), so you can't currently use it with single documents.

## üéâ Use

Here's the short way to add Svelte component you've written to a Quarto doc:

1. Add a magic placeholder block to your document with a [Quarto include](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/includes.html) to the path to your Quarto doc, prefixed with `/.sverto/`. For example:

    ```
    :::{}
    {{{< include /.sverto/example.qmd >}}}
    :::
    ```

2. Import your Svelte component with `Component = import_svelte("Component.svelte")`
3. Add a target block for your visual using `:::` and give it an `#id`
4. Instantiate the Svelte component with `myVisual = Component.default()` using some default props and your target block
5. Update the instantiated component with `myVisual.propName`
6. Render your Quarto project as usual with `quarto render` or `quarto preview`.

**To see this all in practice, check out [`example.qmd`](https://github.com/360-info/sverto/blob/firstrelease/example.qmd).**

## üõç Use other libraries in your Svelte component

If you want to refer to other JavaScript libraries in your Svelte component (like d3, for example), add them to the project using `npm install package1 [package2 ...]`. For example:

```
npm install d3-scale
```

## Use pre-compiled Svelte components

If you'd prefer to compile your own Svelte components instead of letting this extension do it, you can skip steps 1 and 2 and simply refer to the compiled bundle with, for example, `Component = import("Component.js")` in an OJS block.

> **Note:** you must compile the Svelte component to an ES6 bundle, and you must enable accessors when compiling if you want to be able to update them from OJS. Refer to `_extensions/sverto/rollup.config.js` for guidance on configuring Rollup to do this.

## ‚ùì Issues
