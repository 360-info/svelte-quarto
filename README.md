Add Svelte visualisations to your Quarto documents

## üõç Prerequisites

- [Quarto](https://quarto.org)
- [Node and the Node Package Manager (npm)](https://nodejs.org)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Install the project extension using:

```
quarto use template 360-info/sverto@firstrelease
```

This will add the extension itself (which includes some project scripts) to the `_extension` folder, as well as a few other files.

Then run:

```
npm install
```

This will install everything you need for your Svelte components to work to the `node_modules` folder. You won't need to touch this folder, and it doesn't need to go into version control. It'll also create a `package-lock.json`, which you _should_ version control.

## üéâ Use

Here's the short way to add Svelte component you've written to a Quarto doc:

1. Add a magic placeholder block to your document with a [Quarto include](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/includes.html) to the path to your Quarto doc, prefixed with `/.sverto/`. For example:

    ```
    :::{}
    {{< include /.sverto/example.qmd >}}
    :::
    ```

2. Import your Svelte component with `Component = import_svelte("Component.svelte")`
3. Add a target block for your visual and give it an `#id`
4. Instantiate the Svelte component with `myVisual = Component.default()` using some default props and your target block
5. Update the instantiated component with `myVisual.propName`
6. Render your Quarto project as usual with `quarto render` or `quarto preview`.

**To see this all in practice, check out [`example.qmd`](./example.qmd).**

## üì¶ What's in the box?

* [`example.qmd`](./example.qmd): an example Quarto doc that uses a Svelte component
* [`Circles.svelte`](./Circles.svelte): an example Svelte visualisation
* [`package.json`](./package.json): this is used to keep track of the dependencies of your Svelte components. You should add this to version control.
* Once you've run `npm install`, there'll also be a `package-lock.json` and a `.luarc.json`. You should version control these too (although you oughtn't need to edit them manually).

See [`example.qmd`](./example.qmd) to learn how to add Svelte components to your documents and the [Svelte tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics) to learn how to create them.

## üõç Use other libraries in your Svelte component

If you want to refer to other JavaScript libraries in your Svelte component (like d3, for example), add them to the project using `npm install package1 [package2 ...]`. For example:

```
npm install d3-scale
```

## Use pre-compiled Svelte components

If you'd prefer to compile your own Svelte components instead of letting this extension do it, you can skip steps 1 and 2 and simply refer to the compiled bundle with, for example, `Component = import("Component.js")` in an OJS block.

> **Note:** you must compile the Svelte component to an ES6 bundle, and you must enable accessors when compiling if you want to be able to update them from OJS. Refer to `_extensions/sverto/rollup.config.js` for guidance on configuring Rollup to do this.
